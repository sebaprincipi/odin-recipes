#The Odin Project's project for  wraping up HTML knowledge

This is a veeeery basic project to learn the basics of HTML

I Used the basic tags, html,head,body,h(n), p, ul, img, ol and li to make a basic site with Argentine Recipes.

I did this in Ubuntu MATE 21.10, using the UNIX terminal and VScode.
