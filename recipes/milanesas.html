    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pound of thin cut top round beef steaks 6 steaks</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups of bread crumbs or saltine crackers ground into crumbs see note</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black peppercorns</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>i>Grind the garlic clove and peppercorn in a mortar.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk the two eggs lightly and add the garlic and peppercorn mixture. I usually add a Tbsp. of water to the mortar after grinding the garlic and peppercorns.</li>
        <li>In a large dish, spread the bread crumbs mixed with salt, and have another dish ready to place the steaks after breading.</li>
        <li>Dip the steaks into the egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Using kitchen tongs, place one steak into the crumbs, turn to coat both sides. Patting on lightly to make sure the coating adheres to the steak. Place the already-breaded steak aside on a plate. Repeat this step with the remaining steaks.</li>
        <li>Once you finish breading all the steaks you will proceed to fry them. Using a large skillet, heat ½ inch of oil over medium-high heat. Make sure the oil is hot before placing the steaks.</li>
